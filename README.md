# d3-flame-graph

A d3.js library to produce flame graphs.

![Flame Graph example](screenshot.png)

If you don't know what flame graphs are, check [Brendan Gregg's post](http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html).

> Flame graphs are a visualization of profiled software, allowing the most frequent code-paths to be identified quickly and accurately. They can be generated using my open source programs on [github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph](http://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph), which create interactive SVGs.
